    <img class="wrap-text" src="./assets/images/tamami.jpeg" alt="Tamami Polk"><p>I have been in the technology field for a number of years. I began my career as a developer. Over the years, my role
    changed from developer to technical lead to project manager to director of engineering teams. I've been involved in several areas of product delivery process from writing requirements to quality assurance.
    I've managed different types of systems from corporate applications to custom built applications.
</p><p>I really enjoy coding and solving problems. In the last 3-4 years, I've taken the opportunity to code again. My goal is to continue to have a more hands-on role with my team.
</p><p>I enjoy listening to podcasts, music, traveling and reading.</p>
